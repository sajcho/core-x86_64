## Kernel and GCC 12
For users who choose to build a kernel with gcc 12.

The patches you will need to build the kernel can be found here:

https://gitlab.com/cki-project/kernel-ark/-/commit/6a5d9c6e038956adbfef982ac4bf8c2b78cb05d3
and
https://gitlab.com/cki-project/kernel-ark/-/commit/6d02659cb04789f97096a72625e368c7b29bfc6d

There are many warnings when building, but the kernel is fully functional.
